(Original code form April 2010).

Inspired by the puzzle from the game Machinarium.

Notes
=====
Moves should be counted in single units and not individual steps (a snake pulled 3 blocks should count as 1 and not 3) - better user friendliness / cognitve.

"Make a hint" feature.

App as a touch interface for phones and tablets (bacause a lot of dragging is involved). 

Run
===
python Snakes.py

Shortcuts
=========
S : Solve
    Cntrl+S : and draw graph
    Alt+S   : and compute all finals (full graph, takes longer and more memory)
    Cntrl+Alt+S: draws pretty big graph ;)

Bugs
====
Currently the Solver crashes on more complicated graphs (larger ones), giving the error:
    illegal hardware instruction

TODO:
====
* add "eyes" or something to distinguish the pullable components (maybe also add arrows?)
* "hardcore mode" : when life decreses consistenly through the leveles with extra moves
