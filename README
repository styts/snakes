Inspired by the puzzle from the game Machinarium.

Notes
=====
Moves should be counted in single units and not individual steps (a snake pulled 3 blocks should count as 1 and not 3) - better user friendliness / cognitve.

"Make a hint" feature.

App as a touch interface for phones and tablets (bacause a lot of dragging is involved). 


Shortcuts
=========
Cntrl+S : Solve and draw graph
